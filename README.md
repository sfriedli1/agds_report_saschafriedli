# Report for Applied Geodata Science - Sascha Friedli

This repository contains a collection of small Applied Geodata Science projects created as part of an AGDS course report.  
The main deliverables are **five report-style vignettes** (analysis + narrative), supported by reusable helper functions and raw datasets.

## Repository Structure

- **`vignettes/`** – Contains **5 reports** (vignettes).  
  Each vignette is a self-contained geodata science mini-project (data preparation, analysis, and visualization).
- **`R/`** – Helper functions used across the reports (data handling, plotting utilities, spatial helpers, etc.).
- **`data/`** – Raw input datasets required to reproduce the projects.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- R (recent version recommended)
- RStudio (optional but recommended)
- Common R packages for data science and geospatial analysis (install as needed)
- The workflow is reproducible and all the .Rmd files in the vignettes folder can be knitted directly.
